## vue-cli
https://cli.vuejs.org/

> Vue CLI is fully configurable without the need for ejecting. This allows your project to stay up-to-date for the long run.

What is "ejecting"? It's from `react-scripts`:

> Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!
>
> If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
>
> Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
>
> You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.


## pnpm
> Fast, disk space efficient package manager
https://pnpm.js.org/

> pnpm uses hard links and symlinks to save one version of a module only ever once on a disk. When using npm or Yarn for example, if you have 100 projects using the same version of lodash, you will have 100 copies of lodash on disk. With pnpm, lodash will be saved in a single place on the disk and a hard link will put it into the node_modules where it should be installed.
>
> As a result, you save gigabytes of space on your disk and you have a lot faster installations! If you'd like more details about the unique node_modules structure that pnpm creates and why it works fine with the Node.js ecosystem, read this small article: Flat node_modules is not the only way.

I've heard some say that slow and steady long-term gains (i.e. "traditional investing advice") is a boring way to live when you can just make tons of money. Maybe it's different personality types? I'll take predictably boring please.
